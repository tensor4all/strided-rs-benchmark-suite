# Erased Replay Rank/Layout Scaling

This page publishes the before/after evidence for the strided-rs #213
incremental-offset remediation. It covers generic gather, dynamic slice/update,
erased axis reduction, generic pad, and integer divide/remainder zero preflight.

## Reproduce

The measurement source is
`strided-kernel/benches/erased_policy_thresholds.rs` at strided-rs
`53ecd7718169e69320078f4bb2609945140450ac`. Run all groups sequentially:

```bash
CPUS=0-3 STRIDED_RS_REF=53ecd7718169e69320078f4bb2609945140450ac \
  ./benchmarks/strided_benchmarks/erased_replay/run.sh
```

The script refuses a different strided-rs checkout and uses a hash-specific
Cargo target directory. Setup and plan compilation remain outside Criterion
timed regions. It does not automate the load gate: inspect the selected cores
and the rest of their L3 domain immediately before starting it.

## Environment

- measured: 2026-08-24
- CPU: AMD EPYC 7713P, one 8-core L3 domain, four pinned cores
- OS: Linux 6.8.0-101-generic x86_64
- Rust: 1.97.1
- Criterion: 10 samples, 300 ms warmup, 1 s measurement
- sizes: 4,096; 32,768; 262,144; 1,048,576 elements
- contexts: serial and `ExecContext::max_threads(4)`; groups ran sequentially
- load gate: selected cores and the rest of their L3 domain checked before each run

Most baseline/candidate pairs used the same L3 domain. The generic-gather pair
used different domains; its worklog records the approximately 17% control shift,
which is small relative to the reported generic speedups.

### Rank scaling

| Family | Serial rank 2 | Serial rank 4 | Serial rank 8 | 4T rank 2 | 4T rank 4 | 4T rank 8 |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|

### Generic layout controls

| Family | Serial non-unit | Serial negative/crop | 4T non-unit | 4T negative/crop |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| gather | 5.71x | 5.72x | 2.34x | 2.34x |
| dynamic slice | 8.97x | 7.18x | 2.79x | 2.34x |
| dynamic update | 8.01x | 7.38x | 2.46x | 2.22x |
| single-axis reduction | 3.37x | 3.35x | 3.02x | 2.85x |
| pad | 1.99x | 2.29x | 1.41x | 1.34x |
| integer divide preflight | 1.57x | 1.32x | 1.71x | 1.59x |

Existing specialized controls were retained in every upstream matrix. No
accepted implementation had a material specialized-control regression.

## Interpretation

The baseline rank slope came from rebuilding coordinates and checked offsets
inside tensor-sized loops. Preparing or maintaining incremental offsets removes
that rank-multiplied work. Four-thread gains are smaller where memory traffic
or existing partition overhead dominates, but remain positive for the generic
layouts.

The pad series uses the corrected same-domain run at strided-rs worklog commit
`03ed964e`; its earlier 7.5%-load candidate is explicitly reclassified
INCONCLUSIVE. The integer-preflight series includes a documented discarded run
where a shared Cargo target reused the baseline binary. Accepted
baseline/candidate runs used separate target directories; unchanged Add
controls were independently rerun. See strided-rs #213 and the dated worklogs
for confidence intervals, correctness gates, and measurement incident details.
